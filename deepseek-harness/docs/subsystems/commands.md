# Human Commands

English | [中文](commands.zh.md)

The human-command registry service from [`dsh-commands`](../../packages/interaction/commands). Interactive adapters use it to discover and directly execute plugin-owned commands for an exact agent without creating a model message. The [command Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-07-19-plugin-command-registration.md) owns dispatch and lifecycle rationale; the [package README](../../packages/interaction/commands/README.md) owns composition and limitations.

Source: [`packages/interaction/commands/src/index.ts`](../../packages/interaction/commands/src/index.ts)

## Input metadata

The service exposes one optional unstructured-input hint. Command availability follows plugin composition: every adapter consuming the registry sees every effective definition.

```ts type-equiv
/** Immutable metadata for a command's optional unstructured input. */
interface CommandInputDescriptor {
  /** Placeholder shown before the user supplies free-form input. */
  readonly hint: string
}
```

## Definition

`CommandDefinition` is the plugin-authored registration. The registry validates and freezes a detached effective definition.

```ts type-equiv
/** Plugin-owned command registration. */
interface CommandDefinition {
  /** Lowercase command name without the leading slash. */
  readonly name: string
  /** Human-readable summary used in discovery UI. */
  readonly description: string
  /** Optional free-form input hint advertised to capable clients. */
  readonly input?: CommandInputDescriptor
  /**
   * Whether `command/run` records `rawInput`. Defaults to true. A command
   * whose domain event owns the payload sets this false to avoid duplicating
   * that payload in the session log.
   */
  readonly recordInput?: boolean
  /** Execute against the receiving agent without sending the command to the model. */
  readonly handler: (invocation: CommandInvocation) => CommandResult | Promise<CommandResult>
}
```

## Invocation and result

The adapter owns cancellation and passes the exact target agent. `rawInput` begins immediately after the parsed name and retains the adapter-delivered separator and suffix. Results are direct UI outcomes, not tool results or session events.

```ts type-equiv
/** Invocation passed to one registered command handler. */
interface CommandInvocation {
  /** Pairing id already written to this invocation's `command/run` event. */
  readonly commandId: CommandId
  /** Exact agent whose UI received the command. */
  readonly agent: Agent
  /** Exact text following the registered command name, including separator whitespace. */
  readonly rawInput: string
  /** Cancellation signal owned by the dispatching UI request. */
  readonly signal: AbortSignal
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Expected command outcome rendered directly by the dispatching UI. */
type CommandResult =
  | {
    readonly kind: 'success'
    readonly text?: string
    /** Earlier authoritative domain event that owns a richer presentation. */
    readonly sourceEventSeq?: number
  }
  | { readonly kind: 'error'; readonly text: string }
```

`sourceEventSeq` is optional and success-only. When present, it names an earlier non-command event in the receiving session log; `command/done` persists the same reference so a client can combine the command lifecycle with that domain projection without parsing `text` or relying on adjacent rows.

## Discovery and parsing views

Adapters receive handler-free immutable descriptors after scope resolution. `parseCommand()` returns `ParsedCommand` before registry resolution; syntax-valid input can still name an unavailable command.

```ts type-equiv
/** Handler-free immutable command view returned to UI adapters. */
interface CommandDescriptor {
  /** Lowercase command name without the leading slash. */
  readonly name: string
  /** Human-readable summary used in discovery UI. */
  readonly description: string
  /** Optional free-form input hint advertised to capable clients. */
  readonly input?: CommandInputDescriptor
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Syntactically valid slash command before registry resolution. */
interface ParsedCommand {
  /** Lowercase command name without the leading slash. */
  readonly name: string
  /** Exact text following the command name. */
  readonly rawInput: string
}
```

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — this section is byte-identical in both language sides of the page. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.commands` — `CommandRuntime`

Human-command registry. Plain-context definitions are global; definitions registered through a command-injected child of an agent context shadow globals for that agent.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Register a global or calling-agent-scoped command.
 * @param definition - discovery metadata and direct UI handler.
 * @returns the exact effect disposer that unregisters this definition.
 */
register(definition: CommandDefinition): () => void

/**
 * List the effective immutable command descriptors for one agent.
 * @param agent - exact receiving agent and scoped-layer key.
 * @returns name-sorted descriptors after scoped shadowing.
 */
@Remote list(agent: Agent): readonly CommandDescriptor[]

/**
 * Resolve one effective command definition.
 * @param agent - exact receiving agent and scoped-layer key.
 * @param name - command name without a slash.
 * @returns the scoped shadow or global definition.
 */
find(agent: Agent, name: string): CommandDefinition | undefined

/**
 * Parse and execute a known command without sending it to the model.
 *
 * A resolved command's lifecycle is logged: `command/run` is appended
 * before the handler is invoked and `command/done` after settlement (a
 * thrown or aborted handler settles as `kind: 'error'`). Both are direct
 * log-only appends — no turn wraps them, and persistence drains them at
 * ordinary checkpoints. Admission misses (syntax or unknown name) log
 * nothing — they never entered a handler. A `command/run` append failure
 * fails the execution loud; a `command/done` append failure on the
 * handler-failure path is contained so the handler's own error stays the
 * reported failure.
 *
 * @param agent - exact receiving agent.
 * @param line - complete slash-command line.
 * @param signal - cancellation signal owned by the UI request.
 * @returns the settled execution (result + lifecycle pairing id), or
 *   `undefined` when syntax or name does not resolve.
 */
@Remote async execute( agent: Agent, line: string, signal: AbortSignal, ): Promise<CommandExecution | undefined>

### `commands/*` events

<a id="commandschange--emit"></a>

#### `commands/change` — emit

A command was registered or unregistered. This is an unfiltered registry notification because a global or scoped change may affect any UI view. Observer failures are contained and cannot veto the registry mutation.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * A command was registered or unregistered. This is an unfiltered registry
 * notification because a global or scoped change may affect any UI view.
 * Observer failures are contained and cannot veto the registry mutation.
 * @mode emit
 */
'commands/change'(): void
