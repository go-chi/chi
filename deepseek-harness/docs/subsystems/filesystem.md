# Filesystem

English | [中文](filesystem.zh.md)

The optional filesystem capability has four parts: [dsh-fs](../../packages/fs/fs) owns `ctx.fs` and atomic text operations with optional guards, [dsh-fs-local](../../packages/fs/fs-local) implements local disk, [dsh-fs-observation-policy](../../packages/fs/fs-observation-policy) records observed presence or absence and adds freshness rules through events rather than a service, and [dsh-tool-fs](../../packages/fs/tool-fs) directly executes model-facing read/write/edit calls and renders windows. It is outside the agent-loop spine; alternate backends do not change policy or tool schemas.

`dsh-fs-observation-policy` is optional. Without it, the `FileSystem` Service Definition, a provider, and the `dsh-tool-fs` Consumer form the complete, unconstrained filesystem seam: `write` unconditionally creates or overwrites, and `edit` unconditionally replaces literal text. The policy plugin changes these operations by deciding the `fs/*` waterfalls. Removing it does not break the tool because the tool calls `ctx.fs` and dispatches events; it does not call policy methods. A deployment that loads `dsh-tool-fs` is expected to also load `dsh-fs-observation-policy` so the default behavior is read-before-write/edit.

Provider source: [`packages/fs/fs/src/types.ts`](../../packages/fs/fs/src/types.ts) and [`packages/fs/fs/src/index.ts`](../../packages/fs/fs/src/index.ts). Policy source: [`packages/fs/fs-observation-policy/src/types.ts`](../../packages/fs/fs-observation-policy/src/types.ts). Read-rendering source: [`packages/fs/tool-fs/src/read-render.ts`](../../packages/fs/tool-fs/src/read-render.ts).

## Target identity and metadata (provider contract)

Every operation resolves a user-supplied path to an opaque backend target first. Consumers may display `displayPath`, but must not parse `targetKey` (a branded opaque id) or assume it is a local absolute path.

Consumers that share the filesystem's execution world obtain cross-capability coordinates through the provider instead of interpreting that identity: `processPath(target)` returns the canonical absolute path a subprocess can open, `fileUrl(target)` returns its provider-platform `file:` URI, and `contains(parent, child)` tests canonical identity or descendant containment.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * A path resolved by a backend into a stable identity. `resolve()` produces
 * this; every other operation takes it.
 */
interface FsTarget {
  /** Opaque key for stale guards and target lookup. */
  targetKey: FsTargetKey
  /**
   * Path for model/UI-facing output. May be a local absolute path,
   * workspace-relative path, or remote URI depending on the backend.
   */
  displayPath: string
}
```

The backend owns file-version tokens — the freshness token a write/edit guards against. The policy plugin stores them for stale checks; consumers do not interpret them. Both ids are branded opaque strings.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Opaque key for stale guards and target lookup. The local backend uses a
 * realpath-like string; a remote backend might use a workspace URI or file id.
 * Consumers MUST NOT parse it or assume it is a local absolute path.
 */
type FsTargetKey = Branded<'FsTargetKey'>
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Opaque file-version token — the freshness token a write/edit guards against.
 * The local backend derives it from high-resolution stat identity and freshness
 * fields; a remote backend might use a revision id. The policy layer records it
 * for stale checks; consumers may display related metadata but MUST NOT
 * interpret this token.
 */
type FsVersion = Branded<'FsVersion'>
```

`stat` returns metadata (never content), or `undefined` when the target is absent. `type` lets consumers reject directories and special files before reading, and `size` lets text consumers choose `readText` vs `streamText` without probing by failure. A text consumer applies its own retention ceiling while consuming `streamText`. Raw-byte consumers use `readBytes(target, signal, maxBytes)`; its required complete-content cap makes a known or discovered overflow fail with `FS_TOO_LARGE` instead of truncating or buffering without a bound.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Metadata about a target — what {@link FileSystem.stat} returns. Lets the
 * policy layer reject directories/special files before reading and choose
 * `readText` vs `streamText` from `size` without probing by failure. `version`
 * is the freshness token. `undefined` from `stat` means the target is absent.
 */
interface FsInfo {
  /** Opaque freshness token of the target right now. */
  version: FsVersion
  /** Whether the target is a regular file, a directory, or something else. */
  type: 'file' | 'directory' | 'other'
  /** Byte size of a regular file, when the backend can report it. */
  size?: number
}
```

`lstat` is the path-level no-follow metadata primitive. It takes a path instead of an `FsTarget` because `resolve` intentionally follows symlinks to produce stable identity; consumers that need trust-boundary checks can call `lstat` first and reject `symlink` before resolving.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Metadata about a path without following the final path component when it is a
 * symbolic link. Unlike {@link FsInfo}, this path-level probe can report
 * `symlink` so consumers with trust-boundary rules can reject repository-owned
 * links before resolving a target.
 */
interface FsPathInfo {
  /** Opaque freshness token of the path entry right now. */
  version: FsVersion
  /** Whether the path entry is a regular file, directory, symlink, or other. */
  type: 'file' | 'directory' | 'symlink' | 'other'
  /** Byte size of the path entry, when the backend can report it. */
  size?: number
}
```

`listDir` returns direct child entries in stable name order. Each entry carries the child basename, type, resolved target, and cheap metadata when the backend can report it. It must not read file contents, so `size` is only for regular files and `version` is metadata-derived. Broken or disappeared children may be returned as `other` without metadata; permission or backend I/O failures while listing or resolving child metadata fail the whole listing with `FS_PERMISSION_DENIED` or `FS_IO_ERROR`.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One direct child returned by {@link FileSystem.listDir}. Listing returns
 * metadata and resolved targets only; it must not read file contents.
 */
interface FsDirEntry {
  /** Basename of the child inside the listed directory. */
  name: string
  /** Whether the child is a regular file, a directory, or something else. */
  type: 'file' | 'directory' | 'other'
  /** Resolved child target for follow-up operations. */
  target: FsTarget
  /** Opaque freshness token when the backend can report metadata cheaply. */
  version?: FsVersion
  /** Byte size of a regular file, when the backend can report it. */
  size?: number
}
```

## Write and edit guards (provider contract)

Both `writeText` and `editText` take their version guard OPTIONALLY: omit it for an unconditional (bare-provider) mutation, supply it to guard. `writeText`'s guard is an `FsWriteIntent` — `createIfAbsent` creates a missing target and rejects an existing one with `FS_NOT_OBSERVED`, including a target that appears after the provider's initial probe because publication itself must be no-replace; `replaceIfVersion` replaces only when the target exists at the observed version, else `FS_STALE_VERSION`. Omitting `expected` unconditionally creates-or-overwrites. The union itself carries only the two guarded intents; "no guard" is expressed by omission, so write and edit both use the same optional `expected` field.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Guarded write intent. `createIfAbsent` rejects an existing target with
 * `FS_NOT_OBSERVED`; `replaceIfVersion` rejects absence or mismatch with
 * `FS_STALE_VERSION`. Omitting the intent from `writeText` means unconditional
 * create-or-overwrite, not a third union arm.
 */
type FsWriteIntent =
  | { kind: 'createIfAbsent' }
  | { kind: 'replaceIfVersion'; version: FsVersion }
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Outcome of a full-file write. */
interface FsWriteOutcome {
  /** Whether the write created a new file or replaced an existing one. */
  operation: 'create' | 'update'
  /** Opaque version of the file after the write. */
  version: FsVersion
  /**
   * The file's content BEFORE the write, or `null` when the file did not exist
   * (a create) or the backend declined a contextual basis (for example, a
   * binary/non-UTF-8 prior file or either overwrite side reaching its exclusive limit).
   * LF-normalized storage text (the diff basis), never a diff — a consumer
   * computes the result-time contextual diff from `before`/`after` when
   * `before` is present, else falls back to a whole-file diff.
   */
  before: string | null
  /** The file's content AFTER the write, LF-normalized to share `before`'s diff basis. */
  after: string
}
```

`editText` is a provider-level mutation, not a `read` plus `write` composed elsewhere. When guarded it verifies the expected version BEFORE literal matching (so a stale edit reports `FS_STALE_VERSION`, not a match failure against newer content); unguarded it edits the current content. Either way it applies the replacement and writes atomically — keeping matching, line-ending handling, the stale check, and atomic replacement inside one mutation critical section — and a missing target reports `FS_STALE_VERSION` on both paths.

```ts type-equiv
/** A literal-replacement edit request. */
interface FsEditRequest {
  /** Literal non-empty text to replace. Must match exactly (after line-ending normalization). */
  oldString: string
  /** Literal replacement text. An empty string deletes the matched text. */
  newString: string
  /** Replace every match instead of requiring exactly one. */
  replaceAll: boolean
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Outcome of a literal edit. */
interface FsEditOutcome {
  /** Opaque version of the file after the edit. */
  version: FsVersion
  /**
   * The file's content BEFORE the edit. Raw storage text (LF-normalized by the
   * backend), never a diff — a consumer computes the result-time contextual diff
   * (the applied hunk with context) from `before`/`after`.
   */
  before: string
  /** The file's content AFTER the edit. */
  after: string
}
```

## The fs policy events (provider contract vocabulary)

`dsh-fs` owns three events the tool dispatches and the policy plugin listens for, so the emitter (`dsh-tool-fs`) and the listener (`dsh-fs-observation-policy`) share a vocabulary without the emitter depending on the policy plugin. They carry only `dsh-fs` vocabulary plus an opaque `object` actor — no model-facing concepts and no agent/session owner structure.

`fs/write-intent` and `fs/edit-intent` are **single-slot decision waterfalls**: the tool dispatches each with a default thunk returning `undefined` (the bare provider), and a listener fully decides without calling `next()`. The slot is first-wins by registration order — the policy plugin owning it is a deployment convention, not an enforced invariant. `fs/observed` is a fire-and-forget recording event carrying an `FsObservation`: present at a version or confirmed absent. It is dispatched with a plain `ctx.emit`; its listener MUST be synchronous and side-effect-only, because the tool does NOT guard the emit — a throwing listener can replace a read error or surface as the tool's `isError` result after a mutation already succeeded. The generated [cordis surface](#cordis-surface) below shows the exact signatures.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One authoritative observation of a target. A present observation carries the
 * version used by guarded replacement; an absent observation authorizes only a
 * guarded create, never an edit.
 */
type FsObservation =
  | { readonly kind: 'present'; readonly version: FsVersion }
  | { readonly kind: 'absent' }
```

## Execution context (policy plugin)

The policy plugin needs just enough execution context to derive the observed-state owner by narrowing the opaque `object` actor the `fs/*` events carry. `ToolExecution` has the required fields, so `dsh-tool-fs` passes its execution object through as the actor without making `dsh-fs-observation-policy` import the tool, agent, or session packages.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Minimal structural view of a tool execution the policy plugin needs to derive
 * an observed-state owner. `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tools`' `ToolExecution` contains
 * these fields, so the tool passes its `exec` straight through as the opaque
 * `object` actor on the `fs/*` events; this plugin narrows that actor to
 * `FsObservationActor` without importing `dsh-tools`, `dsh-agent`, or `dsh-session`.
 *
 * The owner is `agent.session` when present. It is treated as an opaque object
 * identity (a `WeakMap` key); this package never reads any of its fields.
 */
interface FsObservationActor {
  /** The agent on whose behalf the call runs, when there is one. */
  agent?: {
    /** The session that owns observed-file state, used as an opaque key. */
    session?: object
  }
}
```

## Read outcome (consumer / read rendering)

A text read is bounded by line window, byte cap, and backend limits. After the byte cap is reached, scanning continues without retaining more lines so `totalLines` remains exact. The result the model-facing `read` tool renders is purely presentational; there is no `full`/`partial` view — authorization is freshness-based (the tool emits a present `fs/observed` directly with the stat's version), so any windowed read can authorize a later write/edit when the file is unchanged. A metadata miss emits an absent observation before the tool returns `FS_NOT_FOUND`, allowing a later guarded write to recreate an externally deleted target without authorizing edit. `dsh-tool-fs`, the executor that owns the read, implements read windowing and constructs this result; the policy plugin does not.

```ts type-equiv
/** Outcome of a bounded text read — what {@link formatReadOutput} renders. */
interface FileReadOutcome {
  /** 1-based first line requested. */
  offset: number
  /** Returned lines, already numbered. */
  lines: FileTextLine[]
  /** Exact total line count in the file. */
  totalLines: number
  /** Whether selected output hit the byte cap. */
  truncatedByBytes?: true
}
```

## Observed-file state (policy plugin)

Observed state is a `WeakMap<owner, Map<targetKey, FsObservation>>` held inside the `dsh-fs-observation-policy` plugin. Missing map entry means unseen; `{ kind: 'absent' }` means a `read` or `str_replace_editor` `view`, `str_replace`, or `insert` metadata miss confirmed absence; `{ kind: 'present', version }` means a read, write, or edit observed that version. The write decision maps unseen and absent to `createIfAbsent`, while present maps to `replaceIfVersion`; the edit decision maps unseen to `FS_NOT_OBSERVED`, absent to `FS_NOT_FOUND`, and present to its version guard. The owner is derived from the event actor (normally `exec.agent.session`), treated as opaque and never read. Disposal drops everything (HMR safety), and the policy performs no filesystem I/O.

## Error taxonomy (provider contract)

Filesystem failures use stable `FsErrorCode` strings carried by `FsError` (`HarnessError`). The tool registry preserves `{ name, code }` on error results, so retry, permission, and UI layers can branch without parsing text.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Stable, machine-routable codes for filesystem failures. Carried on
 * {@link FsError}; the tool registry exposes `{ name, code }` on `isError`
 * results so retry/permission/UI layers can branch without parsing messages.
 */
type FsErrorCode =
  | 'FS_NOT_FOUND'
  | 'FS_NOT_DIRECTORY'
  | 'FS_NOT_TEXT'
  | 'FS_NOT_REGULAR_FILE'
  | 'FS_TOO_LARGE'
  | 'FS_PERMISSION_DENIED'
  | 'FS_SANDBOX_DENIED'
  | 'FS_IO_ERROR'
  | 'FS_STALE_VERSION'
  | 'FS_NOT_OBSERVED'
  | 'FS_AMBIGUOUS_EDIT'
  | 'FS_EDIT_NOT_FOUND'
  | 'FS_ABORTED'
```

`FS_NOT_DIRECTORY`, `FS_PERMISSION_DENIED`, and `FS_IO_ERROR` are used by directory listing to distinguish an existing non-directory target, a denied listing, and an unexpected backend I/O failure. `FS_SANDBOX_DENIED` is a POLICY refusal from a sandbox-enforcing backend (`dsh-fs-sandbox`) — the mode fence denied a write/edit — distinct from `FS_PERMISSION_DENIED` (the host kernel refusing). `FS_NOT_OBSERVED` means the policy plugin has no prior-observation record for this owner (or a `createIfAbsent` hit an existing file). `FS_NOT_FOUND` also represents an edit rejected from confirmed absence. `FS_STALE_VERSION` means the backend version no longer matches the observed one (or the provider itself receives an edit for a missing target). Freshness authorization has no partial/full distinction, so there is no `FS_PARTIAL_OBSERVATION`.

## No timeouts on file IO

`read`/`write`/`edit` take **no** `timeoutMs`, and the provider contract arms no deadline — unlike bash and web (which consume [`@deepseek-ai/dsh-timeout`](../../packages/util/timeout/README.md)) and the subprocess-backed `glob`/`grep` (whose declared `timeoutMs` is enforced by `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-call-timeout-policy`): those are process-backed, where a deadline can really kill the work. A local syscall is best-effort-abortable at most — a timeout could not force an in-progress `fsync`/`rename` to stop, so a `timeoutMs` here would be a deadline the seam cannot enforce, and an implicit default in the exact place explicit-over-implicit forbids. Cancellation still propagates through the tool-execution signal for best-effort abort at syscall boundaries.

## The service and the plugin

`FileSystem` (`ctx.fs`, abstract) owns the provider primitives: `resolve`, `processPath`, `fileUrl`, `contains`, `stat`, `lstat`, `readText`, `streamText`, `readBytes`, `listDir`, `writeText`, and `editText`. `dsh-fs-observation-policy` registers **no service** — it is a plugin that adds policy through the `fs/*` event gate: it decides the write/edit intent waterfalls from unseen/absent/present state and records `FsObservation` values. The executor is `dsh-tool-fs`: it reads/writes/edits through `ctx.fs`, dispatches the waterfalls, and emits the recording event. The generated [`ctx.fs` section](#ctxfs--filesystem-abstract-seam) below shows the exact signatures.

### `ctx.fs` — `FileSystem` (abstract seam)
