 * the worker and collides on Python (or vice versa). `__name__` et al. ARE
 * valid portable identifiers, so the identifier rule on
 * `CodeBindingNamespace.global` never rejects them — hence this explicit set.
 * (Error members differ: {@link DUNDER_MEMBER} refuses every dunder form
 * wholesale; binding globals refuse only the names listed here.) `__debug__`
 * is listed for a different reason than a collision: CPython compiles a bare
 * `__debug__` reference to the constant `True` and rejects any assignment to
 * the name at COMPILE time, so an injected global under that name is
 * unreachable from the program — accepted by validation, unusable on the
 * Python backend, which is exactly the split the shared set exists to prevent.
