/**
 * A dependency-light **retention** library: bounded model-facing output for
 * tools that must cap how much context they return. A caller feeds items or
 * text chunks into a bounded object, then gets the retained content plus exact
 * omission metadata ({@link RetainedItems} / {@link RetainedText}).
 *
 * The library owns ONLY the mechanical question "what did we keep, what did we
 * omit?". Tool-specific code still owns
 * business semantics: file grouping, line numbering, exit codes, provider error
 * states, per-line preview truncation, spill files, and the model-facing prose.
 * In particular {@link RetainedText.truncated}/{@link RetainedItems.truncated}
 * means "the retainer omitted otherwise-available content because of a budget" —
 * NOT "the upstream was incomplete". Permission failures, skipped binaries,
 * provider partial failures, and unreadable candidates stay in tool-domain
 * fields, never folded into `truncated`.
 *
 * This is deliberately a library, not a cordis service or plugin: it takes no
 * `ctx`, registers nothing, and emits no events. The two retainers are the only
 * stateful pieces and their state is per-instance (one accumulation), never
 * cross-call. Tool packages import it directly when they need bounded output.
 *
 * The two retainers differ in resource model, which is why they are two names
 * rather than one generic collector:
 * - {@link ItemRetainer} bounds ordered logical units (paths, grep matches,
 *   search sources). `head` retention only in v1.
 * - {@link TextRetainer} bounds byte-oriented text streams (bash stdout/stderr,
 *   web bodies). `head` / `tail` / `headTail`, preserving UTF-8 boundaries at
 *   {@link TextRetainer.finish}.
 *
 * @module @deepseek-ai/dsh-output-retention
