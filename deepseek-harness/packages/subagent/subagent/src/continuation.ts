/**
 * Internal continuable-subagent manager: stable child ids, descriptor
 * persistence, activation admission, the live ownership graph, cold resume,
 * child-first disposal, and settlement delivery to the parent, behind
 * `ctx.subagents`.
 *
 * A continuable child has one durable Session and at most one process-local
 * {@link Activation} — one residency epoch for a reconstructed child Agent. An
 * Activation is not a request, result, cancellation, or Task boundary: it may
 * execute many FIFO turns and stays resident while descendants it created are
 * still running. The Agent inbox is the only turn queue, so this manager owns
 * residency while the Agent loop owns all turn ordering and execution. No
 * continuable path creates a Task or an intermediate result-bearing wrapper.
 *
 * Because residency is this manager's alone to end, telling the parent that a
 * child settled is its job too. An external `subagent/end` listener cannot do
 * it correctly: that payload names no parent, the child handle is already
 * disposed by then, and the release that wakes the parent's own settlement
 * watcher has already run. See {@link SubagentContinuationManager.notifySettlement}.
