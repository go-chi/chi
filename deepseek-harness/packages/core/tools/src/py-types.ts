 * Whether a name can be emitted as a bare Python identifier rather than

 *
 * Python identifiers are not ASCII: `路径` is as legal a field name as `path`,
 * and rejecting it would degrade the whole enclosing object, dropping every
 * field's name, requiredness, and type — information whose only source under
 * `mode: 'code'` is this generated text.
 *
 * NFKC stability is a second and separate condition, because CPython
 * normalizes identifiers at compile time while JSON keys are compared as
 * written: `ﬁeld` would be declared and reachable as `field`, so the SDK would
 * advertise a key under a spelling the harness never accepts, and two keys
 * that normalize together would collapse into one declaration. Those names
 * take the subscript path, which carries their exact bytes.
 *
 * `IDENTIFIER` matches `str.isidentifier()` (measured on Node 22.23.1 vs
 * CPython 3.9.6 tables): the equivalence holds inside the two versions' shared
 * tables, and the skew characters below are exactly where that pair diverges.
 * The predicate as a whole is deliberately stricter than `isidentifier()`,
 * which does not test NFKC stability: `'ﬁeld'.isidentifier()` is True and
 * this returns false.
 *
 * Both conditions are evaluated against the ENGINE's Unicode tables, and the
 * two sides are versioned independently — `\p{XID_Start}`/`\p{XID_Continue}`
 * follow the running engine (Node 22.23.1 reports Unicode 17.0) while CPython
 * follows its own (3.9.6 reports 13.0.0). The skew is not symmetric. A CPython
 * older than the engine is the dangerous direction: a character added to either
 * property since its tables (U+10570 Vithkuqi and U+1E290 Toto, 14.0; U+1E4D0
 * Nag Mundari, 15.0; U+1C89 Cyrillic TJE, 16.0 — ages per `DerivedAge.txt`; all
 * four are NFKC-stable and accepted here, and all four are `Cn` on that 3.9.6,
 * which rejects them) is emitted bare and its tokenizer refuses the character,
 * taking the whole SDK block down — the same parseability invariant
 * {@link UNPRINTABLE}, {@link LONE_SURROGATE} and {@link MAX_LIST_NESTING}
 * exist for. Both properties carry it: a character added only to `XID_Continue`
 * passes the trailing `\p{XID_Continue}*` in a tail position and fails the same
 * way — U+200C ZWNJ and U+200D ZWJ are that case, gaining `XID_Continue` in UCD
 * 15.1 and absent from it in 13.0.0, 14.0.0 and 15.0.0, so `a\u{200C}b` is
 * emitted bare here while `isidentifier()` is False on 3.9.6 and on 3.12.13
 * (15.0.0). A CPython newer than the engine only routes a legal name to the
 * subscript/`dict[str, Any]` path: less readable, still correct. The NFKC
 * condition reduces to the same skew, since normalization stability guarantees
 * an assigned character's normalization never changes afterwards.
 *
 * This predicate is not the only reader of engine tables. {@link camelCase}
 * reads them at three further points — its split set, its head test, and its
 * `toUpperCase()` case mapping — and this predicate's verdict gates none of
 * them: a class name derived there reaches emitted text whenever any object
 * shape in the tool's schema declares a `TypedDict`, including for a tool this
 * predicate rejected. A tool named `zz-\u{1E4D0}x` with such parameters never
 * reaches the skew here (the `-` rejects it outright) yet emits `class
 * Zz\u{1E4D0}xArgs`, which that same 3.9.6 refuses — Nag Mundari arrived two
 * releases after its tables. The case mapping is a separate table rather than
 * an XID membership test, and it fails on names both conditions above accept:
 * `\u{019B}` is XID_Start and NFKC-stable, so this predicate accepts it and
 * `async def \u{019B}` compiles on 3.9.6, but Node uppercases it to
 * `\u{A7DC}` — unassigned in that CPython, whose own `.upper()` is the identity
 * here — and the declared `class \u{A7DC}Args` fails with `invalid
 * non-printable character U+A7DC`. Closing the exposure therefore covers all
 * four read points, not this predicate alone; it needs the target interpreter's
 * version, which the backend reporting `language: 'python'` owns; the
 * language-dispatch Agent Note records the deferral.
 *
 * The `ts-types` sibling keeps its own ASCII rule rather than sharing this
 * one: ECMAScript identifiers are a different set (`$`) and are never
 * normalized, so one predicate cannot be correct for both. ZWJ/ZWNJ are not
 * part of that difference — both sets carry them on the engine's tables; what

 * with zeros (1 significant digit for `1e20`, 16 for `2 ** 60`) — and when the

 * name an integer no double holds. Passing one back would have to cross the

 * `String` is already exact (`2 ** 53`, `1e20`) the two agree byte for byte,
 * and where it is not, `BigInt` is the exact one. The TS flavor needs no
 * counterpart at all: its literal is re-read by a JS parser back into the same

 *
 * `JSON.stringify` is also what keeps this path's output parseable, and it is

 * and the whole D800–DFFF unpaired-surrogate block, escaped under ES2019
 * well-formed stringification, which the engines range guarantees — and the

 * ending it before its terminator. The `description` path carries
 * {@link UNPRINTABLE} and {@link LONE_SURROGATE} because nothing quotes it,

 *

 * controls (NEL among them), and LS/PS (U+2028/U+2029) do reach it raw —
 * legal but invisible, byte-for-byte as in the TS flavor; escaping them is a
 * both-flavors change. Those last three are legal here for the reason
 * {@link UNPRINTABLE} records: they are `str.splitlines()` boundaries, not

const SDK_INSTRUCTIONS = `## Writing code for run_code

\`run_code\` takes two required arguments: \`code\` — the body of an async Python function (top-level \`await\` and \`return\` both work) — and \`description\`, a short summary of what the program does. At run time exactly two of the names declared below are bound: \`tools\` and \`ToolCallError\`. Everything else is a STATIC STUB describing argument and return types — in particular the \`TypedDict\` classes do NOT exist at run time, so build arguments as plain \`dict\`/\`list\` JSON values: \`await tools.name({"field": 1})\`, never \`FooArgs(field=1)\`, which raises \`NameError\`. Inside the program:

- Call tools as \`await tools.name(args)\` — subscript access for exotic, reserved, or underscore-leading names: \`await tools["my-tool"](args)\`. Every call resolves to the tool's typed canonical JSON value (each method's return type below). Tool arguments must be lossless JSON.
- A FAILED tool call raises \`ToolCallError\`, whose \`toolName\` identifies the failed tool and whose message is human-readable — wrap in \`try/except\` to handle and continue.
- Independent read-only calls MAY overlap under \`asyncio.gather\` (safe calls run concurrently; mutating calls run alone, in submission order). Sequence dependent work with \`await\`.
- Emit the run's answer with \`print(...)\` and/or a top-level \`return <value>\`; the returned value must be lossless JSON. Only what you print and return is program output. A successful tool result containing an image is attached after the run so you can inspect it on the next step; every other intermediate result stays out of the conversation, so extract just what you need.

The available tools:`

/**
 * Render the full `tools:sdk` prompt section under `runtime.language ===
 * 'python'`: the Python-flavored usage instructions plus one named `TypedDict`
 * per tool argument or output object (and per nested object) and one awaitable
 * method per visible tool on a `Tools` protocol — typed args in, the tool's
 * canonical output value out — with a `tools: Tools` singleton the model calls
 * into. The `typing` import line lists exactly the symbols the render used.
 * Deterministic — tools are emitted in lexicographic name order, and class
 * declarations precede the protocol in that same order (nested classes before
 * the parent that references them), so an unchanged tool set produces
 * byte-identical text across assemblies. The sort is not a total order on
 * byte-equal names, so two schemas sharing a name would render in argument
 * order; the caller's visible-capability map is keyed by name, so the input
 * never carries a duplicate.
 * @param schemas - the tool schemas plus canonical output schemas to declare
 *   (the caller excludes `run_code` itself).
 * @returns the complete section text.
