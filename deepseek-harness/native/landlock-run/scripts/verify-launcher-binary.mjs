/**
 * Prepack gate for platform packages: refuse to pack a tarball whose
 * declared binaries are missing or built for the wrong architecture.
 *
 * Without it, `pnpm pack` on a checkout that never ran
 * `pnpm run build:native` would ship an EMPTY platform package — the
 * binary's absence surfacing only at runtime as a failed probe on every
 * consumer — and a binary copied across packages would advertise an
 * architecture it cannot execute. The check is presence + ELF `e_machine`
 * against the package's declared `cpu`. `verify-packed-install.mjs`
 * separately pins the installed tarball bytes to the workspace build.
 *
 * Runs from each platform package's `prepack` hook (pnpm sets the script
 * cwd to the package directory). Also callable directly with an explicit
 * package directory: `node scripts/verify-launcher-binary.mjs packages/<name>`.
